# Predicting-Depression
# üß† Predicting Depression from Mental Health Survey Data using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model built with PyTorch to predict the likelihood of depression based on responses to a mental health survey. It includes a real-time prediction interface built using Streamlit.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Domain:** Healthcare / Mental Health
- **Goal:** Predict whether an individual is likely to experience depression
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Web App
